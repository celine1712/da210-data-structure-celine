## Readings for the week

Day        | Reading      | Reading Questions
:--------- |:-------------|:----------------------------------
Monday     | Sections 6.1-6.2  | n/a
Tuesday    | Section 6.3  | 6.33
Wednesday  | Sections 7.1-7.3.2  | n/a
Friday     | Sections 7.3.3-7.3.6          | 7.25, 7.26, 7.31

## Progression

This week we will start Unit 2 on the Tabular Data Model.

Monday: Introduce concept of Tidy Data, discuss the difference between variables and values in a dataset, and recap tabular formats and considerations.

Tuesday: Use the `pandas` Python module to construct data frames.

Wednesday: Expand `pandas` use to column projection and simple column vector operations.

Friday: Consider row selection and more complex row and column combinations.  Also discuss procedural access to `DataFrame`s through iteration.

## Tuesday Software Lab

In the [fourth software lab](../sw_lab/lab_04/README.md), we'll explore using `pandas` to create data frames, explore their metadata, and sort them based on a given variable's values.
