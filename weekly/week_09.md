## Progression

This week, we complete our discussion of hierarchical data with the application of web scraping.  We use web scraping to extract two-dimensional data contained within web pages, and acquire the data through HTTP.  We will end this week by introducing our third and final data model: the Relational Database Model.

Monday: Discuss simple web scraping examples, review.

Tuesday: Complete software lab on more complex web scraping examples.

Wednesday: Quiz 3 (covers nine class periods: Lessons 23-33, including Tues. 3/21).

Friday: We will highlight the most important aspects of the Relational Database Model, with its structure and typical architectures.  We will introduce and define many terms we will need over the next three weeks.  This treatment will give a glimpse at one of the core advantages of databases: **design before data population**.
