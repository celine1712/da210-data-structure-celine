# Planning for Week 2

## High Level Topic Summary

  - \[Review\] Lists and Dictionaries
  - Dictionaries, DoL 2D representation
  - New Python Features
      - Functions as objects
      - Lambda functions
      - List comprehensions

## Readings for the week

Day        | Reading      | Reading Questions
:--------- |:-------------|:----------------------------------
Monday     | n/a      | n/a
Tuesday    | Sections 3.2 and 3.4.1 | 3.35, 3.102, 3.104
Wednesday  | Section 3.1 | 3.1, 3.7, 3.10
Friday     | Section 3.3  | 3.57, 3.59, 3.62

## Progression

Goal of the week is finish review topics and introduce additional Python functionality, which will enable us to begin discussing 2D representations of tabular data.

Monday: No class; attend events in observance of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. instead.

Tuesday: Review/learn about dictionaries and build dictionary-of-list representations of data.  

Wednesday: Refresh various Python patterns (e.g., accumulation) using lists.

Friday: Learn about functions as objects, lambda functions, and list comprehensions.
