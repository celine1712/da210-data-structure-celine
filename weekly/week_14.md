This week is our last full week of class!  We'll explore Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and authentication/authorization.

Monday: We will introduce RESTful Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

Tuesday: We will continue working with APIs, including understanding the provider's requirements for requests and translating to the proper HTTP for making the requests, via a case study using the GitHub API.
