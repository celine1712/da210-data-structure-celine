## Progression

This week, we will finish Unit 4 on the relational model.  Then, we will start Unit 5, focusing on the foundations we need to understand the data-sources dimension to this course.  This week, that will involve understanding where data comes from as well as networking basics.

Monday: We will complete our discussion of principles for designing relational databases by focusing on relationships between tables, and then introduce the SQL syntax for creating tables, including field and table constraints when creating tables.

Tuesday: We will practice creating tables in a database and programmatic table population from a `pandas` `DataFrame`.

Wednesday: Quiz 4 (covers ten class periods: Lessons 35-44, including Tues. 4/11).

Friday: We will broadly discuss data sources, and then introduce the architecture and terminology involved in networking and the use of layers of protocols to decompose a difficult problem into solvable components.
