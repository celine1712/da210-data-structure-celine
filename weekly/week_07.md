## Readings for the week

Day        | Reading      | Reading Questions
:--------- |:-------------|:----------------------------------
Monday     | Section 15.4 | none
Tuesday    | Sections 16.1-16.2 | 16.5
Wednesday  | Section 16.3 | none
Friday     | Sections 4.3.1-4.3.4 | none

## Progression

Last week, we introduced the hierarchical data model and JSON, one of the two most common formats for representing hierarchical data.  We can immediately understand some of the procedural (tree) operations on JSON data, as it only relies on nested Python data structure, which we have seen before.

This week, we extend our discussions to include XML, and then consider procedural tree operations for both JSON and XML data.  At the end of the week, we'll take a brief excursion to discuss regular expressions, which will be handy when we use `XPath` next week.

Monday: Discuss XML as an alternative hierarchical data representation.

Tuesday: Complete software lab on using JSON with Python, as well as JSON procedural operations.

Wednesday: Extend discussion of hierarchical procedural operations to XML-based data structures.

Friday: Explore regular expressions as a means of string matching.
