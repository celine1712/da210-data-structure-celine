# Planning for Week 10

## High Level Topic Summary

  - Single Table SQL
      - Access Operations (rows and columns)
      - Partitioning and Aggregation

## Readings for the week

Day        | Reading      | Reading Questions
:--------- |:-------------|:----------------------------------
Monday     | Sections 11.1-11.2 | 11.7, 11.10, 11.12
Tuesday    | Sections 11.3      | none
Wednesday  | Sections 11.4-11.6 | 11.69, 11.78, 11.80, 11.85
Friday     | n/a                | n/a

## Progression

This week, we dive into the *relational database model*, focusing for now on SQL queries that apply to individual tables.

Monday: We will begin our exploration of the SQL language, and its use in declaring the data desired from single tables in a database, starting with column projection with a local file-based SQLite database.

Tuesday: We will extend our use of SQL to explore row selection.

Wednesday: We will finish exploring single-table SQL expressions, including computing on column-vectors of a result and performing partitioning and aggregation for single tables.

Friday: We will have a work day for your final project!

## Projected Homework

HW | Day Assigned  | Day Due (by 11:59pm) | Contents
:--|:--------|:--------|:------------
[HW_4.a](../hw/HW_4.a/README.md) | Monday (3/27) | Wednesday (3/29) | Single-Table Column Projections

## Tuesday Software Lab

In the [tenth software lab](../sw_lab/lab_10/README.md), we'll continue introducing SQL with single-table selection queries.

_Note:_ Due to our project workday on Friday, this week's software lab won't be due until the following Monday (April 3rd) at 4pm.
