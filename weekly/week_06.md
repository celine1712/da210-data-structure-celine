## Readings for the week

Day        | Reading      | Reading Questions
:--------- |:-------------|:----------------------------------
Monday     | Section 9.2.3, 9.4 | none
Tuesday    | Sections 9.3.2-9.3.4  | none
Wednesday  | n/a  | n/a
Friday     | Sections 15.1-15.3, 2.4 | 15.7, 15.11 (with two tables separately)

## Progression

This week we will complete our unit on the Tabular Data Model.  We will learn about a final transformation operation (pivot) and review Tidy Data requirements.  Then, we'll wrap up the unit by discussing how to apply these transformation operations in settings where they are needed--namely to take data in messy form and to normalize them.  At the end of the week, we'll start our unit on the Hierarchical Data Model by introducing JSON.

Monday: Introduce the tabular transformation operation of pivot and discuss its applications.  Also recap Tidy Data requirements and discuss characteristics of untidy data (therefore, how to recognize why data isn't tidy).

Tuesday: Complete software lab focusing on using tabular transformations to normalize data sets to be tidy.  

Wednesday: Quiz 2 (covers eleven class periods: Lessons 11-21, including Tues. 10/4).

Friday: Formally introduce the hierarchical model, with JSON as an example.
