# Planning for Week 1

## High Level Topic Summary

  - Introduction and motivation
  - GitHub repository setup
  - File systems and how to open/close/read/readline/split files

## Readings for the week

Day        | Reading      | Warm-Up Questions*
:--------- |:-------------|:----------------------------------
Monday     | Syllabus, Preface |
Tuesday    | All of Chapter 1 |
Wednesday  | Section 2.1 | 2.4, 2.7, 2.9
Friday     | Sections 2.2 and 2.3 | 2.21, 2.23, 2.28, 2.54

\*You do not have to turn in answers to these questions, but you are expected to do the reading and ponder the questions before the start of class.

## Progression

The goal for this week is to review and set up for Week 2 on 2D representations of data and new topics of list comprehensions and lambda functions.

- Monday: Discuss our high-level learning objectives for the semester, consider the different ways to represent data, and explore file systems and introduce our use of GitHub in preparation for the first software lab.
- Tuesday: Have the first software lab, in which we get everyone set up with Git and GitHub.
- Wednesday: Explore the file/path hierarchy in operating systems and then review programmatic access in `os`/`os.path` calls from Tables 2.3 and 2.4.
- Friday: Review how to use Python to open and close files and parse file contents line by line.

## Projected Homework

HW | Day Assigned  | Day Due (by 4pm) | Contents
:--|:--------|:--------|:------------
[HW_1.a](../hw/HW_1.a/README.md) | Monday (1/16) | Friday (1/20)** | Short two notebook set
[HW_1.b](../hw/HW_1.b/README.md) | Wednesday (1/18) | Friday (1/20) | Python review and `os` module
[HW_1.c](../hw/HW_1.c/README.md) | Friday (1/20) | Wednesday (1/25) | Python review (cont'd), file processing

\**Homework assignments will typically be due the M/W/F following the class in which they are assigned.  There is extra leniency in Week 1 while we get set up with Git.  However, HW_1.a is primarily a simple test of your computer setup and the homework-submission workflow, so you should try to submit it by Wednesday, and not put it off for Friday.

## Tuesday Software Lab

This first software lab walks you through your computer and Git setup, which is necessary to use `git pull` to get class resources.
