## Class repository for DA 210-02 / CS 181-02

Spring 2023, Denison University

This repository was created for DA 210 - Data Systems, instructed by Professor Tanya Amert. The projects primarily focused on using SQL and Python for web scraping, data cleaning, tidying, and performing basic descriptive analyses. We frequently used Pandas alongside other relevant libraries.
